# Rotations
Rotations addon for The Elder Scrolls Online

This addon shows the optimal skill to cast in the current rotation, it makes the dynamic rotations easier with the static priorities, pretty much like Hekili for World of Warcraft.


It also shows the skill key and whether you need to barswap.


Very early stages of the development.


So far the only supported classes are MAGBLADE, MAGSORC, MAGPLAR and MAGDK with the limited amount of skills.

You can contact me in-game @helixanon or via Discord Helix#4878.
